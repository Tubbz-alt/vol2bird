* `lib` contains the main library 
* `pyvol2bird` is a python wrapper for the library

for compiling the code run `./configure --with-confuse=DIR`,
with `DIR` the root directory of your libconfuse installation (containing subfolders `DIR/include` and `DIR/lib` with the
libconfuse include and library files)

for running the code on a baltrad node add the paths listed in `lib/ldlib.txt` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
